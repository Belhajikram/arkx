Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Risk:
Overview: The application's susceptibility to XSS stems from insufficient sanitization of user inputs before display.

Exploitation Method:

Insert harmful JavaScript into the username section of the login screen.
Execute the form submission.
The harmful script activates upon rendering the login screen, posing risks such as user session compromise or sensitive data theft.
Consequences: This vulnerability allows attackers to run malicious JavaScript under other users' sessions, enabling session control takeover, information theft, or site defacement.

Preventive Measures:

Implement character escaping on user inputs before display.
Apply content security policy (CSP) headers to limit script sources.
Enforce input validation to accept only intended data types.
SQL Injection Risk:
Overview: Direct incorporation of user inputs into SQL queries, without sanitization or the use of prepared statements, makes the application prone to SQL injection.

Exploitation Method:

Place SQL code into login form fields, like username or password.
Complete the form submission.
Direct concatenation of inputs into SQL queries can lead to query manipulation for unauthorized data access or database modifications.
Consequences: This flaw allows attackers to alter SQL queries, enabling authentication bypass, sensitive data access, or database alterations, which can result in data breaches or unauthorized system access.

Preventive Measures:

Utilize prepared statements or parameterized queries to segregate SQL commands from user data.
Apply thorough input sanitization and validation.
Adhere to the principle of least privilege in database access permissions to minimize SQL injection attack impacts.
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Risk:
Overview: The lack of CSRF tokens for request origin verification exposes the application to CSRF attacks.

Exploitation Method:

Create a malicious HTML page with a form that sends requests to application endpoints (like /login or /profile).
Lure logged-in users to visit this page.
Form submissions will involuntarily include the user's session credentials, leading to unauthorized actions.
Consequences: Attackers can unauthorizedly execute actions as logged-in users, such as password changes, transactions, or account modifications without the user's approval.

Preventive Measures:

Integrate CSRF tokens and validate them for each sensitive operation or form submission.
Assign unique tokens per session, embedding them within forms or request headers.
Apply the SameSite cookie attribute to prevent CSRF originating from external sites.
Action Items:
Enhance Input Handling: Strengthen input sanitization and validation to counter XSS and SQL injection threats.
Secure SQL Queries: Transition to prepared statements or parameterized queries for SQL injection prevention.
CSRF Defense: Deploy CSRF tokens with validation on sensitive actions to combat CSRF vulnerabilities.
Session Security: Improve session handling through secure cookies, appropriate session lifetimes, and session hijacking protection strategies.
Final Thoughts:
The uncovered vulnerabilities critically endanger the application and its users' security. Immediate implementation of the suggested preventive strategies is imperative for enhancing the application's security framework. Continuous security evaluations and tests are essential for discovering and rectifying potential vulnerabilities timely.
